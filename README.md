Notes and implementations on DSA

## Variables

variables are storage locations for holding data or different data types (A data type is a set of data with value having predefined characteristics ).

we have two types of data types

- system defined data types (also known as primitives data types)
- and user defined data types.

The number of bits allocated to each primitive data type depends on the programming language, compiler and operating system.

## Data Structure

Data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer memory so it could be used efficiently.
we have two types of data structure, they are:

1. linear data structure: Data is accessed and arranged in a sequential order but not compulsory to store all elements sequentially (e.g linked list) e.g stack, queue, list etc.
2. non-linear data structure: The elements of this data structure are stored and acessed in a non linear fashion e.g trees, graphs etc

## ADTs (Abstract data types)

Primitives data types come along with system implemented operations such as addition, subtraction etc. ADTs are the way to combine data structures with there operations as user defined data types don't come along with those operations cus they are defined by the user. ADTs have two parts

- Declaration of data
- Declaration of operations

## Algorithm and analysis of Algorithm

Algorithms are simply step by step instructions to solve a given problems (the steps need to be proved). Analysis of Algorithm are important to derive the best and efficient way to solve a problem in terms of time, effort and memory consumption as there are numerous ways to solve a problem but few are efficient.
